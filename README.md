# TailorMade

TailorMade is an innovative tool designed to personalize clothing and makeup products based on body type and color palette analysis. It aims to provide users with tailored recommendations that enhance their appearance and fit their unique characteristics.

## Features

TailorMade consists of two main parts:

1. **Body Type Analysis**: Based on input measurements of bust size, waist, hip, and lower hip, TailorMade categorizes the user's body shape and provides clothing recommendations that best suit their body type.
2. **Color Palette Analysis**: Provides a personalized color palette for clothing and makeup based on the user's skin tone, eye color, and hair color, ensuring that the chosen colors complement the user's natural features.
